# Nutanix Calm & Ansible

These Nutanix Calm blueprints will deploy a simple Ansible configuration management environment.

## Components

- 1x Ansible Controller
- 1x VM that acts as an Ansible node (managed by the Ansible Controller)

## Prerequisites

To deploy these blueprints you will need the following things available.

- A CentOS 7 Linux VM image, published via the Nutanix Image Service
- Public and private key for your environment (see [Generating SSH Key](https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/docs/details?targetId=Nutanix-Calm-Admin-Operations-Guide-v10:nuc-generating-private-key-t.html) in the Nutanix documentation)

## Usage

- Import the blueprints into your Nutanix Calm environment
- Adjust credentials to suit your requirements (the import will warn about blueprint validation errors, since credentials are not saved in exported blueprints)
- Alter each Calm service/VM so that it deploys your CentOS 7 image
- Alter each Calm service/VM so that it connects to your preferred network
- Launch the Ansible controller blueprint
- Fill in all required runtime variables
- Launch the Ansible node blueprint
- Fill in all required variables, especially the IP address for your Ansible controller
- After deployment, run the custom action 'ApplyApacheConfiguration' on the Ansible controller
- Browse to the Ansible node's IP address to see Apache has been installed and enabled

## Important Security Note

*This blueprint disables the `host_key_checking` setting within `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.  This is for ease-of-use during demos, only!  Don't do this in production!*
